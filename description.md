# Mentored sprints for diverse beginners
## A newcomer’s introduction to contributing to an open source project

Open source projects such as Python and its multiple stacks (web, scientific, etc.) are nothing but a collaborative effort 
from many community members. It is the constant involvement of the numerous maintainers, contributors, and users that 
make open source software sustainable and keeps the community as a whole going.

Walking the path from user to collaborator, and thus contributing to an open source project, can sometimes be intimidating 
especially for newcomers. From a technical perspective, interacting with web-based hosting services (such as GitHub, GitLab, 
etc.), branching and opening pull requests can be overwhelming if these are not everyday actions of your workflow. 
The correctness of the code and potential bugs are other common obstacles and fears any newcomer might face. Not to 
mention the time and frustration accumulated over the task of finding a ‘beginner-friendly’ issue to work on. 

We also recognise that some groups are traditionally underrepresented in the open source community and we would like to support 
them in their open source path.
For these reasons, we are running the first ever PyCon mentored sprints for individuals from underrepresented groups 
willing to start contributing to Python projects. This event will provide a supportive, friendly, and safe environment for 
all the attendees and partner open source projects.

On the other hand, we are seeking to work with a number of Python projects and their maintainers interested in providing mentorship
to these individuals. We will, as well provide guidance and advise on how to prepare the projects for the day and to better 
serve a diverse range of contributors.

## Why do we need a mentored sprint when we already run sprints within  PyCon?

The PyCon sprints certainly offer a great opportunity to get contributors and developers together and to squash a number 
of bugs in a relatively short period of time. However, with this happening at the end of the event many people, particularly 
less experienced developers, are not able to stay around for this additional time, or cannot easily justify attending an 
event for an extra day or two. In addition, a good amount of the people that attend the sprints are often comfortable doing 
so and in many cases have made multiple contributions to open source before or are, in fact, developers or maintainers of 
open source projects.  

This mentored sprint will provide the attendees with a supportive environment in which they can learn, collaborate, expand 
their network, and celebrate their victories at the end of it.

Also, it will be a good opportunity for a number of open source projects to get some practical advise around inclusion and
how to serve a global and diverse pool of contributors.


## What projects will you be sprinting on?

PyCon US is the biggest Python conference organised every year, thousands of developers, teachers, maintainers, and 
aficionados attend the event every year. As such it provides a unique opportunity to bring together creators, 
maintainers, and users for a few days. 

By running similar events in smaller conferences we have learned that the attendees (and projects) get much more 
out of it by having maintainers, organisers, and attendees working together. This way the maintainers of a certain 
package can provide directed, effective and in-person mentoring to a group of individuals, and the attendees feel 
more confident and usually leave with a high sense of accomplishment. 


## Getting involved

To select the projects we will be sprinting on we will open a global call on the **8th of February 2019** and encourage
maintainers and developers attending PyCon to participate in this mentored sprint.


The call for attendees will also open on the  **8th of February** and we encourage anyone interested to attend.
If you are wondering if this event is for you: it definitely is and we would love to have you taking part in this sprint.
