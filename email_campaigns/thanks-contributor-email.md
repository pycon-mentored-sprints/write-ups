# Thanks for attending the Mentored Sprint for Diverse Beginners at PyCon US 2019!

<insert photo?> (not sure if possile)

We want to take the time to thank each and everyone of you for joining us, for being
excellent, and for contributing to this amazing community. We're inspired to see you
all learning and contributing to open source during the sprint, and we
hope you've been inspired to continue contributing. The Python community is better
because of you ðŸ’œ

This is our first time organizing the mentored sprint and numerous people
have asked when will we do it again! Before we can get to that we'd like to hear
about your experience as a new contributor at the sprint.

We are including an anonymous survey to hear your thoughts on what we can do even
better next time.

# Reflections

We're aware of several issues that occurred during the mentored sprint, such as a late
start, not having power strips in the room, and certain projects didn't have
adequate interest from contributors. We'll be thinking on how to improve on these
next year.

# Thanks to mentors

We're thankful to our mentors for volunteering their time and sharing their knowledge
and passion with all of us. Please take a moment to give them a shout out and celebrate
success using the [#mentoredsprint #pycon2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mentoredsprint%20%23pycon2019&src=typd) hashtag on Twitter.

# Thank you, everyone

The mentored sprint for diverse beginners was a great event only because you showed
up and were the best version of yourself. Thanks for contributing and volunteering.

# Thanks to PyCon staff and The PSF, and PyCon volunteers

We want to extend another big thank you to PyCon Hatchery committee, PyCon staff members, Git
Helpdesk volunteers, and The PSF for their support in making the Mentored Sprint
for Diverse Beginners a success.
