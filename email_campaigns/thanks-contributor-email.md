# Thanks for attending the Mentored Sprint for Diverse Beginners at PyCon US 2019!

<insert photo?> (not sure if possile)

We want to take the time to thank each and everyone of you for joining us, for being
excellent, and for contributing to this amazing community. We're inspired to see you
all learning and contributing to open source during the sprint, and we
hope you've been inspired to continue contributing. The Python community is better
because of you ðŸ’œ

This is our first time organizing the mentored sprint, and numerous people
have asked when will we do it again! Before we can get to that, we'd like to hear
about your experience as a new contributor at the sprint.

We are including an anonymous survey to hear your thoughts on what we can do even better next time.
