{Full name},

Thank you for signing up to the mentored sprint at PyCon US. We’re pleased to welcome you and
help you contribute to open source.

The mentored sprint will take place on **Saturday, May 4th 2:30 PM - 6:30 PM. Room 25C**

Some useful information:

- The mentored sprint is organized as part of PyCon US. You will need to be registered
  for PyCon in order to attend the mentored sprint. If you have not registered, please do
  so as soon as possible, because PyCon is a sell out year after year.
  
- We’re excited to share that 11 open source projects have signed up to mentor! They have
  prepared a list of beginner friendly issues and contributing guidelines. Please check out the
 list of projects here: https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/

- Bring your own laptop. Setting up local environment can be time consuming, and the steps
  can vary from one project to another. We recommend that you check out the contributing
  guidelines of the project that you’re interested in, and pre-install the requirements
  before coming to the sprint. You should also install your favorite IDE or text editor.

By attending the mentored sprint at PyCon, you are also accepting to uphold PyCon and
The PSF’s code of conduct. Please take a moment to read it through at https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/

Thank you again for signing up, and see you soon in Cleveland! Please do not
hesitate to reach us if you have additional questions.
