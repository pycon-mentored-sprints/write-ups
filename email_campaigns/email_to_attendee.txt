Subject: You’re attending the mentored sprint for diverse beginners at PyCon US!

{Full name},

Thank you for signing up to the mentored sprint for diverse beginners at PyCon US.
We’re pleased to welcome you and help you contribute to open source.

The mentored sprint will take place on **Saturday, May 4th 2:30 PM - 6:30 PM. Room 25C**

Some useful information:

- The mentored sprint for diverse beginners is organized as part of PyCon US. You will need
  to be registered for PyCon in order to attend the mentored sprint. If you have not registered,
  please do so as soon as possible, because PyCon is a sell out year after year.
  
- We’re excited to share that 11 open source projects have signed up to mentor! They have
  prepared a list of beginner friendly issues and contributing guidelines. Please check out the
  list of projects here: https://us.pycon.org/2019/hatchery/mentoredsprints/ 

- Bring your own laptop. Setting up your local environment can be time consuming,
  and the step can vary from one project to another. We recommend that you check out the
  contributing guidelines of the project that you’re interested in, and pre-install the
  requirements before coming to the sprint. If you're stuck in any way, let us know so we
  can help. We have also requested each of the projects that signed up to have their
  contributing guidelines up to date by *April 26th*.

Additional pre-requisites:

Python
------
For the mentored sprints we will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Installing all of Python's research packages individually can be a bit
difficult, so we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) which 
provides a variety of useful packages/tools.

To download Anaconda, follow the link https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and select
Python 3. Following the download, run the installer as per usual on your machine.

Git
---

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control software that records changes
to a file or set of files. Git is especially helpful for software developers
as it allows changes to be tracked (including who and when) when working on a 
project.

To download Git, go to the following link and choose the correct version for your
operating system: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

GitHub
------

GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. You will need
to set up an account at https://github.com. Basic GitHub accounts are
free.

Text Editors
------------

Text editors are tools with powerful features designed to optimize writing code.
There are several text editors that you can choose from.
Here are some we recommend:

- Atom. Download at: https://atom.io.
- VS code. Download at: https://code.visualstudio.com/.
- Pycharm. Download at: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.

We suggest trying several editors before settling on one.

By attending the mentored sprint at PyCon, you are also accepting to uphold PyCon and
the PSF’s code of conduct. Please take a moment to read it through at https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/

Thank you again for signing up, and see you soon in Cleveland! Please do not hesitate to
reach us if you have additional questions or would like an extra bit of help preparing
for the sprint.
