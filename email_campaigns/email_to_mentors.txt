Subject: You’re mentoring for the mentored sprint for diverse beginners at PyCon US!

{Full name},

Thank you for signing up to mentor for the {project} project at the mentored sprint for diverse beginners at PyCon US.
We’re pleased to welcome you to the sprint.

The mentored sprint will take place on **Saturday, May 4th 2:30 PM - 6:30 PM. Room 25C**

We have created the following online documentation: https://mentored-sprint-for-diverse-beginners.readthedocs.io/mentor_resources.html

If you have additional resources that can be helpful to other mentors, we welcome your
suggestion and pull request.

Some useful information:

- The mentored sprint is organized as part of PyCon US. You will need to be registered
  for PyCon in order to attend the mentored sprint. If you have not registered, please do
  so as soon as possible, because PyCon is a sell out year after year.
 
- We're excited that numerous projects and mentors have signed up for the sprint! Each
  project will have the opportunity to pitch for their own project to the group. Please
  be prepared with a **3 minute pitch**. Feel free to bring a slide (or two) with more
  details about you and the projects you are mentoring for if you feel like it. **Please
  send us the link to your Google Slides one day in advance.**

- We understand that setting up local environment can be time consuming, and the steps
  can vary from one project to another. To help the event more successful, we recommend
  that you include detailed setup instruction in your project's contributing guideline by
  **April 25th**. This will give the attendees enough time to get set up before PyCon.

- We also recommend that you prepare at least 5 beginner-friendly issues to be worked
  on during the sprint. Here are some ideas to get you started:
  
  * Identify issues that require low-effort involvement (i.e. it will take no more than 
    a couple of hours to complete).
  
  * Get creative: select both coding and non-coding issues to work on the day (i.e. design a
    logo, add sections to the docs, help create a schematic) this will make your project more
    accessible and inclusive for the sprinters.
   
  * Label the issues accordingly on your issue tracker (i.e. beginner-friendly, good-first
    issue, whatever style you follow).

By attending the mentored sprint at PyCon, you are also accepting to uphold PyCon and
the PSF’s code of conduct. Please take a moment to read it through at
https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/code-of-conduct/

Thank you again for your time to mentor! We are grateful for your work in open source and Python.
See you soon in Cleveland! Please do not hesitate to reach us if you have additional questions
or would like an extra bit of help preparing your project for the sprint.
